When I went away to college, no one was around to hold me accountable, and it became even easier for me not to eat. I learned how many calories were in everything I ate, and I limited my intake as much as possible. I lost weight quickly, and I was okay with not eating; after all, the comments and complaints from the people who assisted me had stopped.  It took me a while to realize that the comments had stopped not because of my weight loss but because I had able-bodied, kind peers helping me with my needs, which was a world of difference from a school nurse who should have had more assistance and training before working with me.\nI lost more weight, continued restricting calories, and kept pretending to eat, until I finally grew sick of constantly worrying about calories and always sitting awkwardly next to my friends as they ate. I realized I had become anorexic, and I decided to speak with a peer counselor. Over the next few years of college, I slowly gained weight and I thought I had conquered the illness. After college, I began my career and moved to a brand new city where I had to hire new assistants. The pool of people to choose from was very small, and I had to hire any available aide while waiting to be matched with a better fit. One of the assistants I hired was an older woman had trouble with the physical requirements of the job. Soon after I hired her she began making comments about lifting me, complaining that I was too heavy. \nIt wasn''t long before I returned to the familiar routines of counting calories and not eating; this time, though, I had discovered diet pills. I had no idea what they were doing to my body; I just knew they were helping me to lose weight quickly. I wasn''t even eating enough calories to sustain basic bodily functions, including breathing, and I ended up in the hospital with organ failure. The physical pain was unbearable but the emotional pain of watching my mom in distress was even worse. I eventually became medically stable and once again began the long process of trying to conquer my anorexia; this time, though, I understood that it was something I would always battle, and that recovery is a lifelong journey.
