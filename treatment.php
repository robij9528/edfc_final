			<h2>Start-Up Funding</h2>
			<p>PROGRESS OF LONDON BASED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY:</p>
			<p>Eating Disorders Foundation of Canada has played a major role in the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) purchase of “Bethesda House”. Our Foundation secured acceptance of this location for the treatment of eating disorders through negotiations with the city zoning department, completed an offer to purchase, and transferred the offer to LHSC. LHSC now owns the property and are in the process of renovating it to have their residential treatment facility for eating disorders.</p>
			<p>We have also contributed a start-up donation to LHSC and are hopeful the Bethesda House willbe operational by the end of 2015. Generous donations have allowed us to help in this significant initiative.</p>

			<h2>Transistion Housing</h2>
	
			
			<p>The Eating Disorders Foundation of Canada is currently reviewing appropriate housing for patients who have been discharged from a residential treatment facility and are not yet able to return to their community. The Transition Home would serve as a bridge from residential treatment to community living.</p>
	
			<h3>SAFTA FUND</h3>
			<p>The Safta fund has been created to provide short-term financial assistance of up to $1000.00 for youth/adults in treatment for an eating disorder, who are currently facing an unanticipated financial crisis.</p>
	
			<p>It is difficult to focus on recovery if you have concerns about a place to live, or not being able to afford to finish your school term. This fund will make it possible for us to help provide assistance to out patients in times of crisis. Emergency situations can include and are not limited to urgent educational expenses and living expenses affecting quality of life and recovery. Applicants are currently recovering from an eating disorder and have encountered lack of family/community support, unexpected life events, and lack of financial resources. Applicants do not have other means of financial support and assistance (they may be on social assistance or receiving OSAP).</p>
	
			<p>Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Assistance from this grant is not considered to be a source of routine or long term funding. Applicants must be stable and in recovery.</p>
	
			<p>Prior to completing the application form linked below, please email info@edfofcanada or call 519-858-5111 to ensure there is a surplus of funds as this is available based on Donations!</p>
